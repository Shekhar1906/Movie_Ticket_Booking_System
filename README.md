React Movie Ticket Booking System
This project is a single-page, responsive web application for booking and managing movie tickets. Built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS, it demonstrates core front-end development concepts such as state management, component-based UI, and conditional rendering.

ðŸš€ Features
Homepage: A list of all available movie shows with key information like title, theater, and time.

Dynamic Booking: Users can select a show, choose a ticket category (regular or premium), and book a specified number of seats.

Seat Availability: The application dynamically updates the number of available seats for a show in real-time.

Booking History: Successful bookings are displayed in a list with their details.

Cancellation: Users can easily cancel a booking, which returns the reserved seats to the available pool.

ðŸ’» Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building the user interface.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.

Git: Used for version control, including feature branching and merging, following a professional workflow.
